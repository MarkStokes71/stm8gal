stm8gal
-------------------

A tool for uploading hexfiles to the STM8 microcontroller flash and memory dump to file via COM port using the built-in ROM bootloader (BSL) of the STM8. I wrote this tool, because the similar "Flash Loader Demonstrator" tool by STMicroelectronics supports Windows only.

Content:
  - stm8gal        -> program or read out STM8 via UART bootloader and USB, RS232 or UART interface
  - BSL_activate   -> STM8 project for activating bootloader. For details check 'README'

For more details and instructions on building and using the tool see the Wiki under https://github.com/gicking/stm8gal/wiki

If you find any bugs or for feature requests, please send me a note.

Have fun!
Georg
